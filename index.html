            <p>My name is Jose R. Borja and I am a full stack web developer from Miami, Florida. I'm passionate about technology and web application development. Besides technology I also like most sports. When I'm not writing code I'm probably either practicing one, most likely surfing if the waves are good, or having some scotch/beer with my girl or friends.</p>
            <p>My specialty is back-end development although I do front-end development as well. I'm open for freelancing so if you are interested in working with me feel free to contact me on twitter or click the contact link to send me an email. If you are a recruiter and would like to discuss the projects listed on this page or other apps I have built, get in touch with me using any of the methods listed on this website. If you would like to see some of my work take a look at the 'Projects' section or checkout my <a href="https://github.com/Chakaitos">Github Account</a>.</p>
            <h3 class="intro-title">What is Chakaitos? <span class="pronunciation">pronounced ("cha-KYE-toss")</span></h3>
            <p>It is just a nickname that was given to me by one of my cousins when I was young and ever since a lot of people call me by that name.</p>

            <h4>Austin, TX - May 9, 2014</h4>
              <p>We just finished our second hackathon. This time it was a bit different; there wasn't as much pressure as with the first one since the app we start developing now will become our final project. We are going to have about 3 additional weeks to continue to work on this project and implement all the features to come out with a complete, functional app.</p>

              <div class="blog-pics" align="center"><img class="sleep" src="img/sleep-cycle.gif"></div>

              <p>Our project is called FanClash and it is a fantasy sports-like app but instead of using the traditional daily fantasy format it uses the pick-5 format. It consists of 10 selected players from a round of games. For example: the NBA playoffs have two games tonight the "Heat vs. Nets" and "Trail Blazers vs. Spurs", ten players will be selected from these two games and will be divided into 5 matchups of 2 players each. An example of this would be: "Lebron James vs. Tim Duncan" and 4 more matchups. The user will have to pick whoever they think will do better on each matchup for a total of 5 players selected. The players will receive a score based on their performance and stats on the game. The user with the right picks will win and in the case of a tie, there will be tiebreaker questions and whoever gives the most accurate answer will be the winner.</p>

              <p>The app is still being developed and it won't have any real $ betting functionality until it is fully tested and secure. It will also have a function that will allow playing it with friends. The app is taking shape fast and we are working hard on getting it to a state where it is fully functional so we can release the first version. In the meantime if you would like to see how it works and want to test it you can <a href="http://fan-clash.herokuapp.com/">click here</a>.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <h4>Austin, TX - Apr 12, 2014</h4>
              <p>So my first hackathon just ended a few days ago and my team did really good. To be honest in the beginning I thought we were going to fail really bad; I thought our project was way out of our league. In 2 days we had to build an app called "Moodeo". With this app you are able to hold a video call with a friend and both are able to watch a video simultaneously; this will be a random video that will be selected from our database based on the user's mood (ex: If user selects the mood "funny", a funny video will show for both users).</p>

              <p>The hackathon started Monday at 9am and ended with presentations on Tuesday 5pm. Our group met on that Saturday before the hackathon to get organized, plan, and figure out the approach we were going to take. I have to admit even though we spent quite some time planning we would take long breaks here and there to play "League of Legends" and clear our minds.</p>

              <div class="blog-pics" align="center"><img src="img/hackathon.jpg"></div>

              <p>Monday arrived and the hackathon began. I must say that we did not have it easy, we were not able to use Rails for this app, we had to write all our back-end code in Ruby using of course TDD (Test driven development), we had to have persistence in our data, and use HTML and CSS along with Sinatra to build the client interface. We had very little knowledge of how to add a persistent database, and also had no experience with APIs yet. For this project we also had to use an API called "Opentok" to help us with the video call functionality. We implemented this with Javascript to make the connections and Ruby to generate the session keys necessary to establish a connection between the users.</p>

              <p>We did not get much rest before starting. The day the hackathon started I was fine, but after a full day of coding and writing over 1k lines of code between tests, use cases and methods for our app by 3am, I was dead. We ended up going to bed at 4am. Unfortunately, even though I was extremely tired and running on autopilot, when I laid down in my bed my brain was rolling at 10k RPM. I had at mix of random thoughts- about 80% were code related but everything was unorganized and so I couldn't sleep.</p>

              <p>I woke up at 7am, got ready and went back to work on the app. I was very tired but at least regained some energy that helped me get through the rest of the day. By 12-1pm approximately 90% of our back-end code had been finished, and around 75% for the front-end portion. We still had to implement the main part of our app, the video call between users, and since we had never worked with APIs we had no idea on how to proceed. Short story: we ended up reading a lot of documentation and experimenting with the API and finally about 30 mins before presentation we got it to work. In the last 30 mins we had we implemented it in our client interface and it was a success for the presentation. Even though we had a pretty good product and our presentation was pretty cool we did not have enough time to implement the video playback based on users mood. I must say what we delivered was pretty fuckin' awesome, just hearing the audience's reaction when we tested the video call was good enough (literally I heard a few "Wow!!... What the fuck?!" from the people on the class before us.</p>

              <h4>Post hackathon mistakes...</h4>

              <p>So when the hackathon was over we had a beer keg left to celebrate. I should have gone to sleep and recover, but I decided to stay and play many beer pong games. Not pleased with just the keg, I went on to play some League of Legends instead of getting some rest. I stayed up until who knows what time. For the reminder of the week, and even some days of the following week, I felt like a zombie. I'm definitely going to limit, if not stop playing LoL for good.</p>

              <p>I was lucky enough to come to Austin during this time of the year and got to experience SXSW. SXSW, short for "South by Southwest", is an annual national music and film festival held in Austin, Texas. They feature major musical artists in a line-up along with film, "interactive" and comedy subdivisions. It is the largest music festival in the world.</p>

              <div class="blog-pics" align="center"><img class="sxsw" src="img/sxsw.jpg"></div>

              <p>Lucky me my landlord was a promoter for many of the featured bands so I got to go to many events for free. The cherry on top of the icing was that I got to attend an event for Rails developers at Buffalo Billiards, hosted by an organization called Austin on Rails. I don't know how much this event costs but I got in for free courtesy of Makersquare, open bar and all.</p>

              <p>The event was full of developers from everywhere, I met people from different states and other countries like Argentina and the UK. I even got to play ping pong with the developers at Lonely Planet. After a couple of beers I realized that the scotch (Black Label and above, not that cheap Dewars crap) was free as well, FUCK YEAH!! I forgot to mention that I also got free shirts from different tech companies. Free music events, free booze, free food, free developer events, and free shirts... can this get any better?</p>

              <p><em>What is MakerSquare?</em> It's a full stack web development school, also referred to as a coding bootcamp. I think the term bootcamp is pretty accurate as the curriculum is extremely intense, and requires much discipline and dedication.</p>

              <div class="blog-pics" align="center"><img src="img/mks-logo.jpg"></div>

              <p>Before attending MakerSquare I had been briefly exposed to some code during my IT major. After I graduated I decided to learn programming on my spare time by reading books, doing tutorials and online courses. In doing this I learned a lot, however there were still many key points that I was missing. These key points include: deep understanding of concepts, pair programming or working with a team, the importance of writing tests for code, being a pro googler, and most important to think as a developer, among other things.</p>

              <p>The decision to enroll in this program was not easy as it involved quitting my job, moving from Florida to Texas, taking out a loan, and renting a room in a stranger's house. My strong desire to learn programming and become a great developer led me to make this risky move. I guess later on I will find out if all this was worth it or not. The high intensity of the program makes me wonder how many people will withdraw from it?</p>
